PORTFOLIO SITE DEVELOPMENT BREAKDOWN
====================================

PHASE 1: THE DESIGN PHILOSOPHY ("The Vibe")
-------------------------------------------
Before building components, established "Design Rules" for consistency:

"Content First, UI Second": Minimal design (lots of whitespace/dark space). 
Design proves skills without distracting from content.

"Bento" Aesthetic: Inspired by Apple's promotional materials or linear.app.
Everything organized in boxes (grids), rounded corners, subtle borders.

Micro-Interactions are Key: Every hover reacts. Elements glow, scale, or shift 
on interaction. Static pages are boring.

Typography Hierarchy: Large, bold headings for impact. Muted gray text for 
secondary info. Uses variable font (Inter or Geist Sans) for crisp rendering.

PHASE 2: COMPONENT ARCHITECTURE (The "Lego" Plan)
-------------------------------------------------
Whiteboard breakdown into reusable "Atoms" and "Molecules" using Vite + React:

1. LAYOUT WRAPPER (Layout.jsx)
   - Dark background pattern (dot matrix/grid)
   - Central width constraint (prevents stretching on large monitors)
   - Global font settings

2. NAVIGATION STRATEGY (FloatingDock vs Navbar)
   Thought: "Standard navbars are boring. Want app-like feel."
   Solution: macOS-style Floating Dock (bottom) or sticky header
   Behavior: Accessible but unintrusive

3. SECTIONS (The "Organisms")
   - HeroSection: Big text, profile pic, status ("Open to work")
   - TechStack (Marquee): Infinite scrolling slider shows tool breadth
   - ProjectGallery: Core feature using reusable <ProjectCard />
     Passes data: Title, Desc, Link, Image
   - ContactBlock: Direct email/social access

PHASE 3: DATA STRATEGY (No Backend? No Problem.)
------------------------------------------------
Decoupled data from UI to avoid hardcoding:

CONFIG FILE STRUCTURE (config.ts or data.js):
